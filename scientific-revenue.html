            The Dirty Future of Game Monetization

            Everybody hide your wallets! Well, let me clarify... Whales, hide your wallets game publishers are coming after your money in a new way that'll make resisting those tempting microtransactions even more difficult.
            Let me clarify that further. Whales are a subset of gamers<a href="https://venturebeat.com/2013/03/14/whales-and-why-social-gamers-are-just-gamers/" class="article-links"> defined</a> by their comparatively large amount of spending on in-game microtransactions. Its estimated that
            <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2010/06/22/social-game-whales-are-big-spenders-on-facebook-survey-says/" class="article-links">2% of gamers qualify as whales</a>
            , and while that number may be
            small, they account for the highest revenue game publishers make among all 98% other of players. It's news to nobody that microtransactions in pay-for games are controversial. Essentially, publishers are taking the free-to-play business
            model and shoving it into their games at a full retail price of $60 just to squeeze the extra ounce of coin out of your wallet. Saying its an unpopular practice is an understatment. It's clear microtransactions 
            <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5s-online-mode-has-generated-half-a-billion-do/1100-6438765/" class="article-links">
              make a lot of money
            </a>
            already, but as of now it appears just a fraction of gamers are giving publishers their money through microtransactions. But that fact, that roughly 2% of gamers are coughing up the most money, cannot look appealing to publishers.
            To them that says "there is a larger market to tap into". And that's where we welcome Scientific Revenue into the conversation.

            <a href="http://www.scientificrevenue.com/" class="article-links">Scientific Revenue</a> offers their service to developers and publishers that "delivers the right price, at the right time, for the right buyer". In other words, their service will make a profile of your gaming tendencies including, "wallet spend,
            duration of play, phone type, intensity of engagement, level in game, day of the week, location, and affluence". After collecting that precious information, they deliver targeted pricing to players. This in and of itself, isn't a terrible thing for
            gamers. In fact it's only marketed towards mobile developers on free-to-play models. But you would be almost certainly wrong if you don't believe big games publishers are foaming at their mouths right now, waiting to implenent this or something similar
            into their full $60+ releases. In fact, Jim Sterling 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQsc14gDPbk&t=224s" class="article-links">recently contacted</a>  
            the CEO of Scientific Revenue, asking if publishers have implemented this into their games. Jim recieved several responses, but CEO William Grosso, never touched
            that specific question. As of now, it would seem no AAA games have not implented dynamic pricing, as that would cause a temporary internet meltdown, but that is not cause to feel safe from the idea.
          </p>

          <p class="review-body">
            A key selling point of Scientific Revenue is the easy integration with hugely popular game engines like Unity and Unreal Engine. If Scientific Revenue will make more money offering their services beyond mobile games and if AAA 
            publishers see them as a way of making more profit, then there can be no doubt this will happen in the future. Dynamically priced lootboxes and microtransactions are coming to our games. More and more gameplay elements will be
            locked up behind a paywall, and they are working to make them as appealing to you as they can. It may not happen in 2018 or 2019, but sometime in the next several years, we will see dynamically priced microtransactions in AAA 
            games. And you best lock up your wallet when it comes.

          <p class="review-body">
            We keep seeing more and more instances of publishers sneaking in randomized loot and microtransactions into pay-for games. They used to be in multiplayer games, then they showed up in single player games like 
            <a href="http://www.pcgamer.com/middle-earth-shadow-of-war-will-have-microtransactions-tied-to-its-nemesis-system/" class="article-links">Shadow of War.</a>  
            Publishers are expanding where they put their money-grubbing schemes, and they are planning on expanding their market beyond the easily exploitable. If you give these scoundrels an inch, they'll take a yard. I may sound like the 
            Alex Jones of video games, but I'm right.
